Two types of graph 
--

**Directed Graph** : (no direction between any nodes that are connected ) and 
**Undirected graph**: (Has direction between the connected nodes in the graph).

**Total no of edges in an undirected graph is 2 * noOfEdges in the graph**

**Undirected cyclic graph**: If there is a cycle in an undirected graph ;
**Undirected Acylic graph** : A graph like tree with no cycle. (You can call it as tree as well)

**directed cyclic graph**: If there is a cycle in an directed graph ;
**Directed Acylic graph** : Directed graph that does not have cycle

**weighted Undirected graph** : When the edges in the undirected graph have weights.
