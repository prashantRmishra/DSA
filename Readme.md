# Few methods to keep in minds while solving DSA question

Sorting 2D array (int) 
---

Scenario : {
    Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).
    The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2)
}
```java
Arrays.sort(arr, Comparator.comparingInt(e->e[0]*e[1] + e[1]*e[1]));
```

Converting int to binary and binary to int
---
int to binary
```java
String binaryString = Integer.toBinaryString(intValue);
```
binary to int
```java
int intValue = Integer.parseInt(binaryString,2); // where 2 is the base of the binaryStirng that would be converted into int value of base 10;
```
